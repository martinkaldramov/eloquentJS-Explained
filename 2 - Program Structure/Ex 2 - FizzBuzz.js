/*

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions.
For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz",
for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates.
So if you solved it, youâ€™re now allowed to feel good about yourself.)

for (var i = 1; i <= 100; i++) { // -------- Loop the numbers starting from 1 and including 100
  if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) { // ------- First we need to check if the number is both divisible by 3 and 5 so it does not log just Fizz or Buzz when such a number is encountered
    console.log("FizzBuzz");
  }else if (i % 3 == 0) { // --------------- Logs Fizz if divisible by 3
    console.log("Fizz");
  }else if (i % 5 == 0) { // --------------- Logs Buzz if divisible by 5
    console.log("Buzz");
  }else {
    console.log(i); // --------------------- Logs the number if not divisible by either 3 or 5
