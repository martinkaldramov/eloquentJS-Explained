 # eloquentJS-Explained
This is an explanation of all the examples and exercises in the chapters of the Eloquent JavaScript book Written by Marijn Haverbeke. Eloquent JavaScript is a great introduction to JavaScript and programming in general. The exercises provided at the end of each chapter are a great practice resource. They present challenging problems which require creative solutions using the techniques explained in the chapters.

Sometimes the examples and the excercises are hard to follow especially for people with no programming background and that are new to the JavaScript language. I will try to provide understandable(simpler) explanation to the examples given through the chapters. I will also provide my solutions to the excersises in the book alongside with the solutions provided by the author. Hopefully this will help some people understand the book better since it is one of the best learning sources for JavaScript.

The chapters are seperated in different branches.
